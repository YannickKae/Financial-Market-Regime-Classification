# Market Regime Classification
This repository contains the Python code for comparing the performance of different machine learning models in predicting the best performing strategy (Value or Momentum) in financial time series data. The goal is to identify periods of underperformance for quantitative value or momentum strategies and make appropriate tactical allocation changes. The models we will be comparing include Random Forests, Wasserstein k-means Clustering, Hidden Markov Models, and Gaussian Mixture Models.
